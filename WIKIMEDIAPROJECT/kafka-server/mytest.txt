Artificial Intelligence is the intelligence possessed by the
 machines under which they can perform various functions with human help. With the help of A.I, machines will be able to 
 learn, solve problems, plan things, think, etc. Artificial Intelligence, for example, is the simulation of human 
 intelligence by machines. In the field of technology, Artificial Intelligence is evolving rapidly day by day and it is 
 believed that in the near future, artificial intelligence is going to change human life very drastically and will most 
 probably end all the crises of the world by sorting out the major problems.

Our life in this modern age depends largely on computers. It is almost impossible to think about life without computers. 
We need computers in everything that we use in our daily lives. So it becomes very important to make computers 
intelligent so that our lives become easy. Artificial Intelligence is the theory and development of computers, which 
imitates the human intelligence and senses, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and 
translation between languages. Artificial Intelligence has brought a revolution in the world of technology.
